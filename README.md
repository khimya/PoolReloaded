The Reloaded Pool is a best-of of the concepts seen during the C pool for you
allow you to get back to programming in C in a less hostile environment. These few exercises are to be done in full and perfectly to unlock access
to the next project.
If you have already successfully done some of these exercises while in the pool, we
strongly recommend that you do not give in to the temptation to recover your old code.
Learning programming goes through practice and rendering an existing code doesnâ€™t
no interest.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khimya/Piscine_Reloaded.git
